# Path Planning Project Using C

This is one of the projects which I did in COMP20005 Engineering Computation Semester 1, 2016, at the University of Melbourne. This project was so interesting that I have always remembered it.

A simple path planning algorithm was implemented by using C programming language. For more details regarding the requirements of the project, please see the included PDF file.

Test cases have been included as text files for demonstration purposes.

To compile the project:

```
gcc -Wall -o myass2 myass2.c
```

To run the project with test case 0:

```
myass2 < test0.txt
```
